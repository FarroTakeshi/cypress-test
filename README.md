# cypress-test ðŸ’»

This is a project that I created to practice Cypress and the integrations with differents tools like:
- cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
- Github Action

## Requirements
You need install previously:
- NodeJS >= v22.15
- Cypress >= v11.3

## Installation

First, you need to install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
After that, you're ready to work with this project. To start, you can use the next command to Open the GUI of Cypress:
```bash
npx cypress open
```

## Considerations
1. If you don't want to setup a mix of execution using specs and features using the command "cypress open", edit the **specPattern** in cypress.config.js

```bash
    specPattern: '**/*.{cy.js,feature}', // '**/*.feature' if you just want to execute features for example
    env: {
      filterSpecs: true,
      filterSpecsMixedMode : 'hide'
    },
```

2. If you don't want to setup a mix of execution using specs and features using the command "cypress run" and tags, edit the value of **filterSpecsMixedMode** in cypress.config.js

```bash
    specPattern: '**/*.{cy.js,feature}',
    env: {
      filterSpecs: true,
      filterSpecsMixedMode : 'hide' // 'hide' to avoid specs, 'show' to include specs
    },
```

3. If you want to record and upload it to Cypress Cloud, remember to update the value of your **'projectId'** in cypress.config.js and use the parameter **'--record --key <YOUR_CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY>'**

4. If you want to record and upload it to Cypress Cloud and using **Github Action**, remember to create a secret in your repository for the value of your **<YOUR_CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY>**. If required, update the file **github/workflows/single-test.yml**

```yml
      - name: Cypress test
        run: npm run cy:run:smoke-tests
        env:
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
          TERM: xterm
```
5. If you want to enable the html report generated by cypress-cucumber-preprocessor, update the value of **'enabled'** in the **package.json**  

```bash
    "html": {
      "enabled": false //'true' if you want to generate the HTML report
    }
```
